**The Sparks Foundation - Task 1: Prediction of scores using Linear Regression Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm**
To predict future students score by observing hours studies using the linear regression algorithm

**Technologies and Libraries Used:**
Python3, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib. pyplot, seaborn.

**Project Brief**
In this regression task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This task is a simple linear regression as it involves just two variables(Hours and Scores)
